# Calculator

This project is a simple calculator that supports the basic arithmetic operations **addition** (+), **subtraction** (-),**multiplication** (*) and **division** (/).
The user enters two integers (number 1 and number 2) and an operator.
The calculation is carried out using if/else conditions and the result is output.

## Installation instructions
Java must be installed\
A code editor like VS Code is required

###### Versions
* VS Code Version 1.97.2
* Java Version 23

## Instructions
1. compile the .java file (javac Calculator.java)
2. run the .java file (java Calculator)
3. user input
    a. enter an integer and press \<ENTER\>
    b. enter another integer and press \<ENTER\>
    c. enter an operator and press \<ENTER\> again
4. output
    a. the program performs the correct operation based on the if else condition and prints it on the terminal
5. If the input is invalid, the program ends and prints a message
