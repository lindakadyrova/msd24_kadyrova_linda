# About the Calculator
A calculator is a device or program used for performing arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Calculators come in various forms, from basic handheld devices to complex scientific and graphing calculators. With the advancement of technology, calculators are now integrated into many devices, including computers and smartphones. In modern applications, calculators can handle complex functions like trigonometry, logarithms, and even statistical analysis.

> In programming, creating a calculator is one of the most common beginner projects. It involves writing code that takes user input (usually numbers and an operator), performs the required arithmetic operation, and returns the result. It can be built using various programming languages, and the operations can range from basic arithmetic to more advanced mathematical functions.

## Java and Its Role in Building a Calculator
Java is a widely used programming language, known for its simplicity, portability, and versatility. It is a general-purpose, object-oriented language that allows developers to write code that works across different platforms without modification. Java is widely used in many domains, from building web applications to developing mobile apps and desktop software.

When building a calculator in Java, we can take advantage of Java's rich set of libraries and built-in methods. For instance, Java provides straightforward control flow structures like if/else statements, which can be used to check the operator entered by the user and perform the corresponding arithmetic operation. Additionally, Java's Scanner class is commonly used for capturing user input from the console, making it easy to get the numbers and operator needed for the calculation.

Building a calculator in Java also teaches fundamental programming concepts, such as user input handling, conditional statements, loops, and arithmetic operations. With just a few lines of code, a simple calculator can be built. However, as usersâ€™ needs grow, the application can be expanded to handle more complex operations like square roots, trigonometric functions, and even graphical user interfaces (GUIs).

### Code
When `x = 3`, that means `x + 2 = 5`

    x+1 = 3
    x-3 = 2

```
   xxx
   xxx
```
