**Good Source Code Comments:**
- **Clear and concise:** Focus on *what* the code does, not just *how*.
- **Explain reasoning:** Clarify *why* something is done a certain way.
- **Keep them up to date:** Outdated comments can mislead.
- **Avoid stating the obvious:** Only comment when it adds value.
- **Document edge cases:** Especially for workarounds or known limitations.

**Good Git Commit Messages:**
- **Short, meaningful title (max. 50 chars):** Use imperative mood (e.g., “Fix login bug”).
- **Blank line after the title.**
- **Optional detailed body:** Explain *what* and *why*, if needed.
- **One change per commit:** Keep commits focused and logically grouped.
- **Avoid vague messages:** Skip generic messages like “Update” or “Fix stuff”.
